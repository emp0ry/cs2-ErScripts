### Enhance Your *Counter-Strike 2* Experience  

**ErScripts** is a lightweight, open-source tool crafted for *Counter-Strike 2 (CS2)* fans to personalize and streamline their gameplay. It operates externally—never modifying game memory or files—using only what CS2 provides through console commands, Game State Integration (GSI), and log files.

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer  

**ErScripts** is a personal project by an independent developer, not affiliated with or endorsed by Valve Corporation, the creators of CS2. It offers features like *Auto Accept*, *Jump Throw*, and *Bomb Timer* to enhance convenience and fun. However:  

- **Valve’s Rules**: Some features automate actions via external inputs or scripts. Valve discourages automation in competitive play, and while *ErScripts* avoids game memory manipulation (no VAC violations), **use in official matchmaking may still risk account bans** at Valve’s discretion.  
- **User Responsibility**: You are solely responsible for complying with [Valve’s Terms of Service](https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/) and [CS2 Rules](https://www.counter-strike.net/). The developer is not liable for bans, data issues, or loss of functionality.  
- **Intended Use**: This tool is for personal enjoyment, experimentation, and learning—not for gaining unfair advantages. Use it responsibly in appropriate settings (e.g., private servers or casual play) to respect the CS2 community.

## ✨ What is ErScripts?  

**ErScripts** is a utility that adds convenience and flair to CS2 through an external overlay and automation features. It leverages:  

- **External Overlay**: Tracks CS2’s window for visual enhancements.  
- **Config & Binds**: Executes commands via CS2’s built-in `exec` system (e.g., `bind "KEY" "exec erscripts"`).  
- **Game State Integration (GSI)**: Reads live game data like weapon status or bomb timers.  
- **Console Logs**: Parses `console.log` for events like match acceptance.  

No game files are altered beyond user-created configs, and no hacks are involved—just clean, creative tools for CS2 enthusiasts.

## 🛠️ Installation  

Get started easily:  

1. **Download**: Grab the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/emp0ry/cs2-ErScripts/releases).  
2. **Set Launch Options**: In Steam, add `-conclearlog -condebug +bind scancode104 exec erscripts1` to CS2’s launch options.  
3. **First Run**: Launch `ErScripts.exe` *before* CS2 (afterward, it’s fine to start with CS2 running).  
4. **Play**: Open CS2, config settings in the ErScripts menu (*press Insert to open or hide the menu*), and enjoy!  
5. **Exit**: Close via the "X" button in the menu or press the "End" key.  
6. **Fullscreen Mode**: To play in fullscreen mode, right-click `cs2.exe`, go to **Properties → Compatibility**, and **uncheck** the *Disable fullscreen optimizations* box.

### Auto Accept  
- **Waiting Time**: Delay (in seconds) before searching for the "Accept" button.  

### Bomb Timer  
- **Scale**: Adjust timer size.  
- **Gradient**: Enable/disable gradient icon.  
- **Transparency**: Set background opacity.  

### Sniper Crosshair  
- **Reload Icon**: Syncs with your in-game crosshair settings.  

### Keystrokes

- **Gradient**: Toggle gradient text.  
- **Animation Speed**: Speed of keypress animations.

### Kill Sound, Round Start Alert  
- **Volume**: Adjust sound loudness.  
- **File Name**: Specify the WAV file for the custom sound.
  - Leave empty to use the default sound.
  - Enter a custom WAV file (e.g., `sound.wav`) located in the executable’s folder.
  - You can write without specifying `.wav` (e.g., if it’s `sound.wav`, just write `sound`).
  - You can use a subfolder like `sounds` (e.g., `sounds/audio.wav` or `sounds/audio`).
  - If the file is missing or invalid, it defaults to the built-in sound.

## 🧠 How It Works  

*ErScripts* enhances CS2 safely and externally by:  

- **Command Sending**: Features like *Jump Throw*, *Drop Bomb*, and *Auto Pistol* work by writing CS2 commands (e.g., `+jump; -attack`) to numbered config files (e.g., `erscripts1.cfg`). These are triggered via pre-bound keys (e.g., `F13` to `F24`) simulated by *ErScripts*. In CS2, you bind a key to `exec erscripts1` (set via launch options), and *ErScripts* presses that key to run the command.  
- **Auto Accept**: Monitors `console.log` for match detection, then simulates a mouse click on the "Accept" button.  
- **Sniper Crosshair**: Reads active weapon data from GSI and overlays a custom crosshair synced with your settings.  
- **Bomb Timer**: Tracks bomb state via GSI, updating the display with defuse urgency cues.  
- **RGB Crosshair**: Cycles colors by sending console commands to adjust crosshair settings.  
- **Knife Switch**: Uses `switchhands` via config files triggered by keybinds.  

This method relies entirely on CS2’s native systems—no memory reading, writing, or injection—keeping it aligned with standard scripting practices while avoiding game file tampering.
